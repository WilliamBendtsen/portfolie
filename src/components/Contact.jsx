      <p>
        I&apos;m a very flexible person when it comes to both time management
        and what kinds of tasks you provide me. I can work at any given hours of
        the day you want me to, and i exel equally in both group work involving
        colleagues with multiple moving parts, and just allowing myself to
        completely involve myself with a project on my own
